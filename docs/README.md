## What it is

When you develop an application, you want to focus the development in features and not really in the UI (event if it's important). 
It's why I create this project to be more productive to create really cool app for the PSVita community.

The project is inspired by Vue.JS and by Material Design guidelines for the Ui.

You can use this project like a boilerplate to create your own app. It is structured to be really easy to understand and to be maintained with the future kit update.
