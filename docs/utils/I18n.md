## Language files

The language files are in JSON format and need to be in the i18n folder. Your file need to be named with the language code.

For example, I want to do a french translation so I need to create a file `fr.json` placed in the folder i18n. 

Note : don't forget to add your translation files in the `cmake/Files.txt`



## Functions

### Constructor

#### UtilsI18n()

Load the translation file in relation to the PSVita language.

#### UtilsI18n(int lang)
* (int/SceSystemParamLang) lang: The language need to be load.

Load the translation file in relation to the PSVita language.

For example :
```cpp

```
